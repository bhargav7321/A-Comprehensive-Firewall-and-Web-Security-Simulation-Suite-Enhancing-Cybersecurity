A Comprehensive Firewall and Web Security Simulation Suite Enhancing Cybersecurity with Advanced Firewall and Web Security Simulations

CyberShield is an advanced simulation suite designed to enhance cybersecurity by focusing on comprehensive firewall and web security simulations. It provides robust testing and evaluation capabilities aimed at fortifying defenses against modern cyber threats, ensuring robust protection for digital assets and sensitive information.

Main Class (WebSecuritySimulator): This class demonstrates basic functionality for simulating web requests, both GET and POST, with encoded payloads.

simulateRequest() Method: This method generates a simulated request to a vulnerable endpoint (targetUrl) with a payload ("<script>alert('XSS')</script>"), encoding it using URLEncoder.encode() to simulate XSS payload injection.

sendGetRequest(String url) Method: Sends a GET request to the specified URL (targetUrl) and prints the response code and content.

sendPostRequest(String url, Map<String, String> postData) Method: Sends a POST request to the specified URL (targetUrl) with the provided postData, encoding each key-value pair and printing the response code and content.
